# Github Level Badger

This is a little automated script using github actions that will update this badge here:

<a id="githubLevelId" href="https://github.com/aubelsb2/github-level"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Github Level%20version1-221-yellowgreen" alt="Github level 221"/></a>

When you fork this project and when you manually rerun the badge. 

You can update the badge by creating a reverse pull requests to the project, once you have done so it will update. Watch this project for updates to know when! (Maybe I might automate that?)

Don't forget to enable workflow actions if you haven't by clicking on "Actions" and accepting.

# Personal repo

If you set `USER_GITHUB_SECRET` token in your fork of this AND if you have a self named repo.. Ie in my case I have a repo: https://github.com/arran4/arran4 it will create a PR for a badge update to that repo too. 

Version one is just rather simple. Looking for suggestions in the form of PRs!

# "Git it a go" -- Fork it!

# Updating

It will update the badge approx every friday depending on time zone.
